The code provides a comprehensive analysis of Multiple Linear Regression models for predicting CO2 emissions based on different features like engine size, cylinders, and fuel consumption.

The coefficients of the linear regression models indicate the impact of each feature on predicting CO2 emissions.

The Mean Squared Error (MSE) provides a measure of the model's accuracy, and the Variance Score indicates how well the model explains the variance in the data.
